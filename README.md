A Java playground for experiments, creative builds, and skill-sharpening projects.

# ☕ Java Playground: Where Code Meets Creativity!

Welcome to my personal Java project space — a playground where simple ideas turn into working code,  
console experiments grow into GUI wonders, and prototypes shape into future-ready real-world applications.

This is more than just code — it’s my collection of learning, experiments, and future career-building showcases.  
A space for trying out ideas, breaking things (on purpose), and discovering what works (and what doesn't).

Stay tuned — more experimental stuff and magic coming soon!
